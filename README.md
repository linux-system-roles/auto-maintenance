# shellcheck

When making edits, use `shellcheck *.sh` to check your scripts for common
shell script problems.  On Fedora, `dnf -y install ShellCheck`. There is
currently no way to disable a check by using a mnemonic string or keyword
value - you must use a code like `SC2034`. See
https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/issues/1948 - In the meantime, if you
need to disable a check, add a link to the ShellCheck wiki like this:
```
# https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2064
# shellcheck disable=SC2064
trap "rm -f ${STDOUT} ${STDERR}; cd ${HERE}" ABRT EXIT HUP INT QUIT
```
So that someone can easily figure out what this code means.  NOTE that the
link must come first, followed by the comment with the shellcheck disable
directive.

# lsr_role2collection.py

This is a tool to convert a linux-system-role style role to the collections format.

## usage
```
lsr_role2collection.py [-h] [--namespace NAMESPACE] [--collection COLLECTION]
                       [--dest-path DEST_PATH] [--tests-dest-path TESTS_DEST_PATH]
                       [--src-path SRC_PATH] [--src-owner SRC_OWNER] [--role ROLE]
                       [--new-role NEW_ROLE] [--replace-dot REPLACE_DOT]
                       [--subrole-prefix SUBROLE_PREFIX] [--readme README]
                       [--extra-mapping EXTRA_MAPPING] [--meta-runtime META_RUNTIME]
                       [--extra-script EXTRA_SCRIPT]

```

### optional arguments
```
-h, --help           show this help message and exit
--namespace NAMESPACE
                     Collection namespace; default to fedora
--collection COLLECTION
                     Collection name; default to system_roles
--dest-path DEST_PATH
                     Path to parent of collection where role should be migrated;
                     default to ${HOME}/.ansible/collections
--tests-dest-path TESTS_DEST_PATH
                     Path to parent of tests directory in which rolename directory is
                     created and test scripts are copied to the directory; default to
                     DEST_PATH/NAMESPACE/COLLECTION
--src-path SRC_PATH  Path to the parent directory of the source role;
                     default to ${HOME}/linux-system-roles
--src-owner SRC_OWNER
                     Owner of the role in github. If the parent directory name in SRC_PATH is
                     not the github owner, may need to set to it, e.g., "linux-system-roles";
                     default to the parent directory of SRC_PATH
--role ROLE          Role to convert to collection
--new-role NEW_ROLE  The new role name to convert to
--replace-dot REPLACE_DOT
                     If sub-role name contains dots, replace them with the specified
                     value; default to '_'
--subrole-prefix SUBROLE_PREFIX
                     If sub-role name does not start with the specified value, change
                     the name to start with the value; default to an empty string
--readme README      Path to the readme file used in top README.md
--extra-mapping EXTRA_MAPPING
                     This is a comma delimited list of extra mappings to apply when converting
                     the files - this replaces the given role name with collection format with
                     the optional given namespace and collection as sell as the given FQCN with
                     other FQCN.
                     The format is
                       "src_name:[[dest_namespace.]dest_collection.]dest_name,\
                        ...,
                        src_FQCN:[[dest_namespace.]dest_collection.]dest_name,\
                        ..."
                     The default for `dest_namespace` is the `--namespace` value,
                     and the default for `dest_collection` is the `--collection` value.
                     `src_name` is the name of a role, preferably in `namespace.rolename` format.
                     If just using `rolename` for `src_name`, and `rolename` is used in places
                     in the README that you do not want to change, you may have to change the
                     README in another way, not using this script, by using sed with a custom
                     regex.
                     In addition, 'fedora.linux_system_roles:NAMESPACE.COLLECTION' is in the
                     mapping, 'fedora.linux_system_roles' is converted to 'NAMESPACE.COLLECTION'.
--meta-runtime /path/to/runtime.yml
                     This is the path to the collection meta/runtime.yml - the default is
                     $HOME/linux-system-roles/auto-maintenance/lsr_role2collection/runtime.yml.
--extra-script /path/to/executable
                     This is a script to use to do custom conversion of the role.  For example,
                     to convert uses of filter plugins to FQCN.  If you do not specify anything,
                     then it looks for an executable file named `lsr_role2coll_extra_script` in
                     the role root directory, and runs it.  The arguments such as dest dir,
                     namespace, etc. are passed in via environment variables.  See the code for
                     the list of environment variables available.
```

### environment variables

Each option has corresponding environment variable to set.
```
  --namespace NAMESPACE            COLLECTION_NAMESPACE
  --collection COLLECTION          COLLECTION_NAME
  --src-path SRC_PATH              COLLECTION_SRC_PATH
  --dest-path DEST_PATH            COLLECTION_DEST_PATH
  --role ROLE                      COLLECTION_ROLE
  --new-role NEW_ROLE              COLLECTION_NEW_ROLE
  --replace-dot REPLACE_DOT        COLLECTION_REPLACE_DOT
  --subrole-prefix SUBROLE_PREFIX  COLLECTION_SUBROLE_PREFIX
```
The default logging level is ERROR.
To increase the level to INFO, set `LSR_INFO` to `true`.
To increase the level to DEBUG, set `LSR_DEBUG` to `true`.

## Table of original and new locations

In this table, DEST_PATH/ansible_collections/NAMESPACE/COLLECTION is represented as COLLECTION_PATH. Assume the role name to be converted is myrole.

| Items | Original roles path | New collections path |
|-------|---------------------|----------------------|
| README.md | SRC_PATH/myrole/README.md | COLLECTION_PATH/roles/myrole/README.md [[0]](#0) |
| role | SRC_PATH/myrole/{defaults,files,handlers,meta,tasks,templates,vars} | COLLECTION_PATH/roles/myrole/* |
| subrole | SRC_PATH/myrole/roles/mysubrole | COLLECTION_PATH/roles/mysubrole [[1]](#1) |
| modules | SRC_PATH/myrole/library/*.py | COLLECTION_PATH/plugins/modules/*.py |
| module_utils | SRC_PATH/myrole/module_utils/*.py | COLLECTION_PATH/plugins/module_utils/myrole/*.py [[2]](#2) |
| tests | SRC_PATH/myrole/tests/*.yml | COLLECTION_PATH/tests/myrole/*.yml |
| docs | SRC_PATH/myrole/{docs,design_docs,examples,DCO}/*.{md,yml} | COLLECTION_PATH/docs/myrole/*.{md,yml} |
| license files | SRC_PATH/myrole/filename | COLLECTION_PATH/filename-myrole |

#### [0]
A top level README.md is created in COLLECTION_PATH and it lists the link to COLLECTION_PATH/myrole/README.md.
#### [1]
If a main role has sub-roles in the roles directory, the sub-roles are copied to the same level as the main role in COLLECTION_PATH/roles. To distinguish such sub-roles from the main roles, the sub-roles are listed in the Private Roles section in the top level README.md.
#### [2]
In the current implementation, if a module_utils program is a direct child of SRC_PATH/module_utils, a directory named "myrole" is created in COLLECTIONS_PATH and the module_utils program is copied to COLLECTIONS_PATH/plugins/module_utils/myrole. If a module_utils program is already in a sub-directory of SRC_PATH/module_utils, the program is copied to COLLECTIONS_PATH/plugins/module_utils/sub-directory.

```

# release_collection.py

This script is used to:
* Check all of the roles for new versions, and update `collection_release.yml`
  with the updated `ref` fields.
* Convert the roles to collection using [lsr_role2collection.py](#lsr_role2collectionpy)
* Update the version in `galaxy.yml`
* Build the collection file using `ansible-galaxy collection build`
* Check the collection using `galaxy-importer`
* Publish the collection using `ansible-galaxy collection publish`
* Additionally, instead of the upstream sources, the rpm file could be used as
  an input. If the option is selected, it skips the first 3 items and builds the
  collection file using `ansible-galaxy collection build` with `galaxy.yml` or
  `MANIFEST.json` in the rpm file.

The list of roles is specified by default in the file `collection_release.yml`.
You can use the `--include` and `--exclude` options (described below) to control
which roles you want to update and release in the collection. The format of this
file is a `dict` of role names.  Each role name is a dict which must specify the
`ref` which is the git tag, branch, or commit hash specifying the commit in the
role repo to use to build the collection from. You can optionally specify the
`org` (default: `linux-system-roles`) and the `repo` (default: role name).  The
use of the tag in semantic version format is strongly encouraged, as the script
can automatically update the collection version in `galaxy.yml` if all of the
tags are semantically versioned (see `--no-auto-version`, `--new-version`).

The other collection metadata comes from `galaxy.yml` - namespace, collection
name, version, etc.  The script can update the `version` field automatically if
all updated roles are using semantic versioning (see `--no-auto-version`,
`--new-version`).

The script reads the list of roles from `collection_release.yml` and modifies
the list depending on `--include` and `--exclude`.  For each role, it will clone
the repo from github to a local working directory (if there is no local clone).
By default, the script will attempt to determine if there are any updates to the
role by comparing the `ref` in the file with the latest commit.  If both refs
are tags in the format of a semantic version, the script will attempt to
automatically determine what the new semantic version of the collection should
be.  See the `Version` section below for details.  If using the `--no-update`
flag, then the script will assume the user has already updated
`collection_release.yml` to the correct ref and will checkout that ref.  If you
have a local working copy of the roles, you can specify it with the `--src-path`
argument, or the script will use a tmp directory.

The script calls [lsr_role2collection.py](#lsr_role2collectionpy) to convert
each role to collection format using the galaxy namespace name and collection
name specified in `galaxy.yml`.  The script will use
`~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/$NAMESPACE/$NAME` to convert the
files into and assemble the other metadata (such as the ignore files).  If you
want to use a different directory, use `--dest-path`.  After all of the roles
have been converted, the script uses `ansible-galaxy collection build` to build
the collection package file suitable for publishing.  The file will be placed in
the `~/.ansible/collections` directory.  If the `--dest-path` exists, and you
want to replace it, use the `--force` argument.

The script will then run `galaxy-importer` against the collection package file
to check if it will import into galaxy cleanly.  If you get errors, you will
probably need to go back and fix the role or add some suppressions to the
`.sanity-ansible-ignore-x.y.txt` in the role, where `x.y` is the version of
ansible that `galaxy-importer` is using.

By default, the script will not publish the collection to Galaxy.  Specify the
`--publish` argument to publish the collection to Galaxy.  The script will then
do something like this:
```
ansible-galaxy collection publish -vv ~/.ansible/collections/NAMESPACE-COLLECTION_NAME-VERSION.tar.gz
```
and will wait until the publish is completed.  If you do not want to wait,
specify the `--no-wait` argument which will do something like this:
```
ansible-galaxy collection publish --no-wait ~/.ansible/collections/NAMESPACE-COLLECTION_NAME-VERSION.tar.gz
```
If the script is unable to calculate the new version for `galaxy.yml` you will
need to figure out what the new semantic version will be, and use the
`--new-version` argument.

## Pre-requisites

`git clone https://github.com/linux-system-roles/auto-maintenance [-b STABLE_TAG]`

`STABLE_TAG` can be omitted to use `master`.

Or, figure out some way to download the correct versions of
[lsr_role2collection.py](#lsr_role2collectionpy), `galaxy.yml`,
`collection_release.yml`, and `release_collection.py` from this repo.

You should ensure that the roles have been appropriately tagged with semantic
versions.  You are strongly encouraged to use
[role-make-version-changelog.sh](#role-make-version-changelogsh) to tag, release, and
publish the individual roles.  If you do this, then you can usually let the
script automatically update the versions in `collection_release.yml` and
`galaxy.yml`.  Otherwise, you will need to ensure that the information in
`galaxy.yml` (particularly the `version:` field), and the information in
`collection_release.yml` (particularly the `ref:` fields), are correct and
up-to-date for the collection you want to build and publish, then use the
`--no-update` argument.

You will need the `galaxy-importer` package - `pip install galaxy-importer --user`.
You will need `docker` in order to use `galaxy-importer`.

## collection_release.yml format
```yaml
ROLENAME:
  ref: TAG_OR_HASH_OR_BRANCH
  org: github-organization  # default is linux-system-roles
  repo: github-repo  # default is ROLENAME
  sourcenum: N
```
Where `ROLENAME` is the name of the role as it will appear in the collection
(under `NAMESPACE/COLLECTION_NAME/roles/`).  `ref` is the git tag in semantic
version format (preferred), commit hash, or branch to use (in the format used as
the argument to `git clone -b` or `git checkout`).  `org` is the github
organization (default `linux-system-roles`).  The `repo` is the name of the repo
under the github organization, and the default is the `ROLENAME`, so only use
this if you need to specify a different name for the role in the collection. The
`sourcenum` is the source number in the RPM spec file.  For example,
https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/linux-system-roles/blob/rawhide/f/linux-system-roles.spec#_93
```
%global rolename1 postfix
%deftag 1 1.3.4
```
The `sourcenum` for the `postfix` role is 1.

The `sshd` role currently uses both `org` and `repo`.

To add a new role - add it with a `ref: null`, and `sourcenum` as the next
available sourcenum value.
```yaml
ad_integration:
  ref: null
  sourcenum: 23
```

*NOTE*: Please keep the file in order of `sourcenum`.

Then the next time you run `release_collection.py`, it will know that this is a
new role and will update the versions accordingly.

Example:
```yaml
tlog:
  ref: 1.2.12
  sourcenum: 8
kernel_settings:
  ref: 1.1.13
  sourcenum: 9
logging:
  ref: 1.11.6
  sourcenum: 10
```
This will use e.g.
`git clone https://github.com/linux-system-roles/tlog -b 1.2.12`, etc.

Use [role-make-version-changelog.sh](#role-make-version-changelogsh) to create new
tags/versions in each role.  If you use strict semantic versioning everywhere,
in your github tags and in the `collection_release.yml` file, you can use the
automatic versioning feature of the script to automatically update the version
in `galaxy.yml`.

## Usage
Basic usage:
```
cd auto-maintenance
python release_collection.py --publish
```
This will use the `galaxy.yml` and `collection_release.yml` files in the current
directory, will create a temporary working directory to clone the roles into,
will create a collection under
`$HOME/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/NAMESPACE/COLLECTION_NAME`, and
will create the collection package file
`$HOME/.ansible/collections/NAMESPACE-COLLECTION_NAME-VERSION.tar.gz`, where
`NAMESPACE`, `COLLECTION_NAME`, and `VERSION` are specified in `galaxy.yml`, and
will publish the collection, waiting until it is completed.

## Options

* `--galaxy-yml` - env: `GALAXY_YML` - default `galaxy.yml` in current directory
  - full path and filename of `galaxy.yml` to use to build the collection
* `--collection-release-yml` - env: `COLLECTION_RELEASE_YML` - default
  `collection_release.yml` in current directory - full path and filename of
  `collection_release.yml` to use to build the collection
* `--src-path` - env: `COLLECTION_SRC_PATH` - no default - Path to the directory
  containing the local clone of the role repos - if nothing is specified, the
  script will create a temporary directory
* `--dest-path` - env: `COLLECTION_DEST_PATH` - default
  `$HOME/.ansible/collections` - collection directory structure will be created
  in `DIR/ansible_collection/NAMESPACE/COLLECTION_NAME`  - collection package
  file will be created in `DIR`
* `--force` - boolean - default `False` - if specified, the collection directory
  will be removed first if it exists, and the package file, if any, will be
  overwritten
* `--include` - list - default empty - by default, the script will operate on
  all roles in the `collection_release.yml`.  Use `--include` to specify only
  those roles you want to update in the new collection.  If you specify both
  `--exclude` and `--include` then `--exclude` takes precedence.
* `--exclude` - list - default empty - by default, the script will operate on
  all roles in the `collection_release.yml`.  Use `--exclude` to remove the
  specified roles from that list.  If you specify both `--exclude` and
  `--include` then `--exclude` takes precedence.
* `--new-version` - string - The new semantic version to use for the collection.
  The script will update this
* `--use-commit-hash` - boolean - By default, only tags in semantic version
  format will be used for the `ref` field in `collection_release.yml`. If
  instead you want to use the latest commit hash for a role that has not been
  tagged, use this flag. However, this means you will not be able to use
  automatic versioning, and you will need to use `--new-version`, or manually
  edit the `collection_release.yml` and `galaxy.yml` and use `--no-update`.
* `--use-commit-hash-role` - list - By default, use whatever is the value
  of `--use-commit-hash`.  There are some cases where you want to use the
  tag for all roles *except* one or a few.  In that case, you can use
  `--use-commit-hash-role role1 --use-commit-hash-role role2` to specify the
  roles for which you want to use the commit hash, and use the tag for all
  other roles.
* `--no-auto-version` - boolean - By default, the script will attempt to
  update the collection version in `galaxy.yml`.  Use this flag if you do
  not want to do that.
* `--no-update` - boolean - By default, the script will attempt to update the
  `ref` fields for each role in `collection_release.yml` and the version in
  `galaxy.yml`.  Use this flag if you do not want to do that.
* `--publish` - boolean - By default, the script will just create the collection
  tarball in `~/.ansible/collections`.  You must specify `--publish` if you want
  to publish the collection.
* `--no-wait` - boolean - By default, when publishing, the script will wait
  until the publishing is completed.  Use `--no-wait` if you do not want to
  wait, and instead will check the import status in Galaxy.
* `--skip-git` - boolean - If set to `true`, use local source. By default, `false`.
* `--skip-check` - boolean - If set to `true`, check using galaxy-importer is
  skipped. By default, `false`.
* `--skip-changelog` - boolean - By default, the script will attempt to generate
  a collection changelog from the individual role changelogs.  Use
  `--skip-changelog` if you do not want to do this.
* `--debug` - boolean - By default, the script will only output informational
  messages.  Use `--debug` to see the details.
* `--rpm` - string - Specifies the rpm file for the input collection. When --rpm
  is set, other input options such as `--galaxy-yml`, `--include`, `--exclude`,
  `--new-version`, `--use-commit-hash`, and `--no-auto-version` are ignored.
  Note: if the rpm file does not contain `galaxy.yml` or `MANIFEST.json` in
  `/path/to/ansible_collections/namespace/collection`, `release_collection.py`
  fails.  No default value.
* `--extra-mapping` - string - same as the `--extra-mapping` argument to
  lsr_role2collection
* `--changelog-rst` - boolean - by default, CHANGELOG.rst will not be created -
  set this to create CHANGELOG.rst from docs/CHANGELOG.md.  You must not use
  `--skip-changelog` if you want to use `--changelog-rst`.

## Version

For the `version:` field in `galaxy.yml`, we have to use `X.Y.Z` where `X`, `Y`,
and `Z` are non-negative integers.  We will start at `0.0.1` until the
collection stabilizes, then we should start at `1.0.0`.  During this
stabilization period, we should just increase the `Z` number when we do a new
release.

We assume that each role will be doing regular tagged releases where the tag is
the semantic version.  If not, then it will be difficult to determine what sort
of change the role has made, and how it should affect the collection version.
The [role-make-version-changelog.sh](#role-make-version-changelogsh) script is useful to
identify what sort of changes were made in each role, update the semantic
version tag, do github releases, and publish individual roles to Galaxy.  You
are strongly encouraged to use that script.

The collection version will be derived from all of the role versions, and will
be semantic versioned.

Notation: `Xr` is the `X` number from the version of a given role `r`.  `Xc` is
the `X` number for the collection `c`.  Similarly for `Yr`, `Yc`, `Zr`, and
`Zc`.

Examine the versions in the updated roles and compare them to the roles in the
`collection_release.yml`.

If any of the `Xr` has changed, set the new `Xc` to `Xc + 1` - bump major
release number to indicate there is a role which has introduced an api breaking
change, and set `Yc` and `Zc` to `0`.

If none of the `Xr` has changed, and if any of the `Yr` has changed, set the new
`Yc` to `Yc + 1` - bump minor release number to indicate there is a role which
has introduced a non-breaking api change, and set `Zc` to `0`.

If none of the `Xr` or `Yr` has changed, and if any of the `Zr` has changed, set
`Zc` `Zc + 1` - some role has changed.

If the role does not use a semantic version for the tag, or it is otherwise
unclear how to determine what sort of changes have occurred in the role, it is
up to the collection maintainer to investigate the role to determine how to
change `Xc`, `Yc`, or `Zc`.

# manage-role-repos.sh

This script is useful for the linux-system-roles team to make changes to
multiple roles.

## Prerequisites

This script uses `gh` for cli/api interactions with github, and `jq` for
parsing and formatting the output of `gh`.  You can install these on Fedora
like `dnf -y install jq gh`.  The `gh` command also requires the use of your
github api token.  See `man gh` for instructions.

## Usage

Basic usage, with no arguments:
```
LSR_BASE_DIR=~/linux-system-roles ./manage-role-repos.sh
```
This will clone all of the repos under https://github.com/linux-system-roles
(except those listed in `$EXCLIST` - see the script for the default list e.g. it
excludes repos such as `test-harness`, `auto-maintenance`, etc.).  These will be
cloned to `$HOME/linux-system-roles` using the `gh repo clone` command (if the
directory does not already exist).  Each repo will be forked under your github
user using the `gh repo fork` command (if you do not already have a fork).  Each
local clone will have a git remote named `upstream` for the source repo, and a
git remote named `origin` for your fork.  It will also do a `git fetch` to pull
the latest code from the remotes (but it will not merge that code with your
local branches - you must do that if desired).

## Options

Options are passed as environment variables.

`LSR_BASE_DIR` - local directory holding clones of repos - no default - it is
recommended you use a temporary directory. If you do not specify this, the
script assumes you want to perform some action e.g. `gh pr list` in each role
that does not require a local clone, and will not clone the repo locally.

`LSR_GH_ORG` - the github org to use as the origin of the clones/forks e.g. the
ORG used in `https://github.com/ORG` - default is `linux-system-roles`

`DEBUG` - turns on `set -x`

`MAKE_FORK` - default `true` - this is only used if you also specified
`LSR_BASE_DIR` - this will ensure that you have a fork of the role repo, for
example, so that you can create working branches in your private repo in github
and use that to submit PRs.  If you set this to `false`, then some actions may
not work.

`RENAME_FORK` - default `false` - if you use `true`, then the script will ensure
that your private fork will be renamed `linux-system-roles-$ROLENAME`.

`REPOS` - default none - a space delimited list of roles.  Use this if you want
to operate only on the given roles.
```
# only manage the network and storage roles
REPOS="network storage" ./manage-role-repos.sh
```

`EXCLIST` - default none - a space delimited list of roles.  Use this if you
want to operate on all roles *except* the given roles.
```
# manage all roles except the network and storage roles
EXCLIST="network storage" ./manage-role-repos.sh
```

## Commands

You can pass commands to perform in each repo in these ways:

### command line arguments

For each repo, checkout the main branch and make sure it is up-to-date:

```
LSR_BASE_DIR=~/working-lsr ./manage-role-repos.sh "git checkout main || git checkout master; git pull"
```

The arguments will be passed to `eval` to be evaluated in the context of each
repo.  This is useful if you need to just refresh your local copy of the repo,
or perform a very simple task in each repo.  Remember to escape
shell variables that will be set in `manage-role-repos.sh`.

To list all non-draft PRs in all repos:
```
./manage-role-repos.sh gh pr list -R \$LSR_GH_ORG/\$repo --search draft:false
```

### stdin/here document

You can do the same as above like this:

```
LSR_BASE_DIR=~/working-lsr ./manage-role-repos.sh <<EOF
git checkout main || git checkout master
git pull
echo \$repo
EOF
```

That is, you can pass in the commands to use in a `bash` `here` document.  This
is useful when you have more complicated tasks to perform that takes multiple
commands and/or involves shell logic/looping.  Whatever you specify in the here
document will be passed to `eval` in each repo directory.  Remember to escape
shell variables that will be set in `manage-role-repos.sh`.

### shell script

For really complex repo administration, you may want to write a shell script to
be executed in each repo:

```
./manage-role-repos.sh /path/to/myscript.sh
```
For example, to update changelog in every role:
```
BRANCH=changelog-20230417 LSR_BASE_DIR=~/working-lsr \
  ./manage-role-repos.sh /path/to/role-make-version-changelog.sh
```

# check_rpmspec_collection.sh

This script is to be executed in the dist-git directory. It locally builds rpm
packages with various combination of `ansible` and `collection_artifact`
options, and checks whether the built rpm count is correct or not. Then, it
verifies that `README.html` files are only in /usr/share/doc/ area.

Usage: ./check_rpmspec_collection.sh [ -h | --help ] | [ fedpkg | rhpkg [ branch_name ] ]

# role-make-version-changelog.sh

This script is used to create a new version, tag, and release for a role.  It
will guide you through the process.  It will show you the changes in the role
since the last tag, and ask you what will be the new semantic version to use for
the tag.  If the commits are in Conventional Commits format, it will
automatically determine the new semantic version of the role and prompt you to
use it, or provide your own version.  It will then put the changes in a file to
use for the update to the CHANGELOG.md file for the new version, and put you in
your editor to edit the file.  If you are using this in conjunction with
`manage-role-repos.sh`, it will push the changes to your repo and create a pull
request for CHANGELOG.md. Once the CHANGELOG.md PR is merged, there is github
action automation to tag the repo with the version, create a github release, and
import the new version into Ansible Galaxy.  You must provide a branch for the
PR, or if you are not using the script with `manage-role-repos.sh`, you can
create a branch in your local clone directory.
```
BRANCH=my_branch_name LSR_BASE_DIR=~/working-lsr ./manage-role-repos.sh `pwd`/role-make-version-changelog.sh
```
If the role has commits that do not follow the Conventional Commits, format, but
you still want to create a new release, use `ALLOW_BAD_COMMITS=true`, and then
you may need to provide your own new version if the script was unable to
determine the new version from the bad commits.
If the role has no changes since the last tag, the script will skip processing
the role.  If you do not want to do this, use `AUTOSKIP=false`, and you will be
prompted for a new version/tag.

NOTE: You must install and configure `gh` in order to create the pull request.
If you want to have more control over the commit, commit msg, and PR, then you
can clone the repo manually, create the branch, and run
`role-make-version-changelog.sh` in the local repo clone directory.  This will
not push or create a PR.

This script is highly interactive.  Since we are using semantic versioning, we
use Conventional Commits format to determine the semantic changes from the
commits in the log.  The script will use this to determine the new version
number, and prompt you to use this version, or you can provide your own version.
The script will show you the commits since the last tag, and will optionally
show you the detailed changes.  It will then prompt for the new version which
will also be used as the git tag.  If you enter 'y' here, it will use the new
version automatically determined from the Conventional Commits.  You can also
provide your own version here, or hit Enter/Return to skip and go to the next
role.  If you do want to provide your own version, enter a tag/version in the
form of `X.Y.Z`, based on the semantic changes to the role.  You will then be
prompted to edit CHANGELOG.md for the release.  The body will be filled in by
the commit messages from the commits since the last tag - you will need to edit
these. When you are done, it will make a commit in your local repo.  If you are
using it with `manage-role-repos.sh`, and `gh` is installed and configured, it
will push the changes to your repo and create the PR.

Use this script, and ensure the CHANGELOG.md PR is merged, and the repo is
tagged and released, before you run
[release_collection.py](#release_collectionpy).

# role-manage-prs.sh

Used in conjunction with `manage-role-repos.sh`.  This will list the non-draft
PRs for a role and prompt for merging one of them.  The list will include the
checks and tests status for the PR.  Actions:

* `NUM` - Enter the PR number to merge it.  Uses `gh pr merge NUM -r -d`
* `l` - Refresh the list
* `w` - View the list of PRs in a browser
* `v NUM` - View the PR in a browser
* `a NUM` - Merge PR with admin override.  This uses `gh pr merge NUM -r -d --admin`
* `t NUM` - View detailed status of tests/checks not reporting SUCCESS
* `ci NUM` - Add `[citest]` comment to PR to trigger CI testing
* `s NUM /path/to/script` - Run a script against a PR.  The role name and PR
  number are passed to the script.  This can be used to perform whatever action
  you want against the PR e.g. check logs for specific errors.
* `c NUM [comment]` - Close PR with optional comment
* `d NUM [diff args]` - View diff with optional args
* `e NUM [edit args]` - Edit the PR with optional args
* Press Enter by itself to skip to the next role

By default, the list will only include PRs authored by you.  Use `AUTHOR=@all`
to view PRs from all authors. Use `AUTHOR=username` to view those PRs authored
by the given username.

Examples:

`./manage-role-repos.sh ./role-manage-prs.sh` - View all non-draft PRs authored
by myself

`AUTHOR=@all ./manage-role-repos.sh ./role-manage-prs.sh` - View all non-draft
PRs

`AUTHOR=richm ./manage-role-repos.sh ./role-manage-prs.sh` - View all non-draft
PRs authored by richm

* `AUTHOR` - default is `@me` - look for PRs authored by this username.  Use
  `@all` to list all PRs.
* `DELETE_BRANCH` - default is `true` - use `false` if you do not want to delete
  the PR branch after merging (the `gh pr merge` flag `-d` is used to delete the
  branch)
* `MERGE_TYPE` - default is `r` (rebase and merge) - Use `m` for merge commit,
  `s` for squash and merge, or `ask` which will prompt you for the merge type.

# list-pr-statuses-ghapi.py

Allows you to query the set of all PRs open across all repos.  By default, it
will print out all open PRs, along with their statuses and checks, along with
some other metadata.  There are a number of command line options to look for
specific repos, platform status, ansible version status, staging vs.
production, and many more.  See the help for the command for more information.

# bz-manage.sh

## Intro

This tool is primarily for downstream maintainers for various administrative
Bugzilla tasks such as creating new system roles BZs, checking if a BZ in a
specified release has a clone in other releases, setting the ITM and DTM fields
for BZs in a given ITR, managing the `devel_whiteboard` field, and printing git
commit and changelog entries.

See also
[RHEL Development Guide](https://one.redhat.com/rhel-development-guide/#assembly_rhel-9-development_rhel-dev-guide)
for more information about the Bugzilla workflow.

## Requirements

You must have the `bugzilla` cli tool (provided by the `python-bugzilla-cli`
package on Fedora).

You must have an authentication API key configured
[API Key](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/userprefs.cgi?tab=apikey) - see
[Authentication](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/docs/en/html/api/core/v1/general.html#authentication)
and `man bugzilla` - the section "AUTHENTICATION CACHE AND API KEYS" for more
information.

You must have the `jq` cli tool (provided by the `jq` package on Fedora).

## Commands

### setitm, setdtm
Use this to set the ITM or DTM for all BZ in a given ITR and given STATUS to a
given value, if the ITM/DTM is less than the given value.  For example, you have
several BZ in the POST status for ITR 8.7.0, and you need to ensure that all of
them have an ITM of at least 23 - if the ITM is not set, set it to 23 - if the
ITM is set to a value less than 23, set it to 23 - if the ITM is set to a value
of 23 or higher, do not touch it.
```
ITR=8.7.0 ITM=23 STATUS=POST ./bz-manage.sh setitm
```

### reset_dev_wb
Use this to remove `qa_ack?` from the `Devel Whiteboard` field if the BZ has
been given `qa_ack+`, and remove `pre-verify?` from the `Devel Whiteboard`
field if the BZ has been given `Verified:Tested`.
```
ITR=9.1.0 ./bz-manage.sh reset_dev_wb
```

### new
Create a new system roles BZ.  NOTE: Does not use any environment variables -
all parameters are passed in on the command line.  All parameters are required.
Usage:
```
./bz-manage.sh new X.Y "SUMMARY" "COMMENT" ROLENAME
```
* `X.Y` - the major.minor version (e.g. 8.7) - the ITR will be set to `X.Y.0`
* `SUMMARY` - the BZ summary/title
* `COMMENT` - the initial BZ comment
* `ROLENAME` - name of role - the whiteboard field will be updated with
`role:ROLENAME` - use `""` if you want to leave the field blank e.g. the BZ
corresponds to multiple roles

For example, to create a new 9.1
BZ:
```
./bz-manage.sh new 9.1 "kernel_settings mis-configures memory settings" \
  "I can reproduce on rhel-9 but not rhel-8" kernel_settings
```
NOTE: You will have to edit the BZ after creation.  And the RHEL Bugzilla
workflow tools automatically edit the BZ several times. It may take a few
minutes after you create a new BZ that you can actually edit it without having
your edits overwritten or discarded.

### clone_check
Check that the BZs of a given ITR and STATUS all have an appropriate clone.  It will
check that there is a clone, that the clone has the same SUMMARY, and that the clone
has the same STATUS.
```
ITR=8.7.0 STATUS=POST ./bz-manage clone_check
```
e.g.
```
ERROR: bz 2066876 status [POST] does not match clone 2072745 status [ON_QA]
```
The clone check is not perfect, so be sure to check manually.

### rpm_release
Use `USE_RST=1` to generate the new CHANGELOG text in rST.  By default, it
will use Markdown (.md).
Use `RELEASE_PLUS=false` to list all BZs, even if they do not have `release+`.
By default, will only list BZs that have `release+`.
Use this to generate the following files:
* new-cl.md or .rst - The new text to add to the CHANGELOG.md or .rst
* cl-spec - The new text to add to the spec %changelog section
* git-commit-msg - The git commit message

For example - I have several BZ in POST that I am doing a new build for ITR 8.8.0.
The new version will be 1.22.0.  NOTE that the version in CHANGELOG.md
is different from the version in the spec file - so you will need to add
the `-N` for the RELEASE for the spec file version in cl-spec.
I want to update the CHANGELOG.md, the spec %changelog, and the git commit
message with the information from all of these BZ, formatted in the correct
manner for all of these.  You will need to edit all 3 files:
* Edit CHANGELOG.md and add the contents of new-cl.md in the right place
* Edit the spec file to add cl-spec in the right place, and ensure the name
  and email are correct.
* Edit the git-commit-msg with the correct git subject line.  You can then
  use this file with git commit -F

Example:
```
ITR=8.8.0 ./bz-manage.sh rpm_release 1.22.0
# edit CHANGELOG.md - put the contents of new-cl.md at the top
# edit the spec file - put the contents of cl-spec at the top
#   of %changelog - edit the name, email, and add the -N to the version
# edit git-commit-msg - add a descriptive subject line
git add CHANGELOG.md, the spec file, sources, .gitignore ...
git commit -F git-commit-msg
```

### update_doc_text

Update Doc Types and Texts in Bugzilla based on the [conventional commits format](https://linux-system-roles.github.io/contribute.html#pr-description-format).

For example, to run against BZs with ITR 9.3.0, enter `ITR=9.3.0 sh ./bz-manage.sh update_doc_text`.

When run, the script searches all PRs from the ITM and other filters provided and does the following:

1. If a BZ has a `required_doc_text` flag set to `+` or `-`, the BZ is skipped. `+` indicates that the doc text has already been verified by a tech writer. `-` indicates that no release note is required.
2. If a BZ has `required_doc_text?` set and GitHub PR attached:
    1. If the existing Doc Text is empty, automatically add Doc Text from PR description.
    2. Else, print the current Doc Text and Doc Type, print the GH PR info, and ask users if they want to update the Doc Text.
3. If a BZ has `required_doc_text` unset and GH PR attached:
    - Automatically add Doc Text from PR description
4. If a BZ has `required_doc_text` not set to `+` or `-` and GitHub PR not attached:
    - Print the current doc text and type, and ask user if they want to post a comment asking to attach a GH PR or enter the Doc Text.

### list_bzs

Generate a list of BZs to stdout.  e.g. to list all BZs in POST state that have
been acked for 9.3.0:
```
# ITR=9.3.0 STATUS=POST RELEASE_PLUS=true ./bz-manage.sh list_bzs
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2179460 role:selinux use restorecon -T 0 on supported platforms
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2180902 role:certificate add mode parameter to change permissions for cert files
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2211187 role:kdump support auto_reset_crashkernel, dracut_args, deprecate /etc/sysconfig/kdump
```

## Parameters

Almost all parameters are passed as environment variables.  However, the `new`
command takes all parameters on the command line - see above.

### ITR
default "8.8.0" - the Internal Target Release of the BZ to manage

### ITM
Internal Target Milestone - used with `setitm`

### DTM
Dev Target Milestone - used with `setdtm`

### STATUS
BZ status e.g. `NEW`, `ASSIGNED`, `POST`, etc.  Most commands only operate on BZs that
have the specified STATUS - the primary exception is `reset_dev_wb`.

### LIMIT
By default, the limit on the number of BZ returned by a query is 100.  Use LIMIT to
change that value.

### RELEASE_PLUS
By default, will list all BZs.  If you only want to look for BZs that have
`release+`, use `RELEASE_PLUS=true`.  Note that `rpm_release` by default is the
opposite, because you typically want BZs that have `release+` for that
particular query.

There are other undocumented environment variables used, check the code for more details.

# manage_jenkins.py

Manage the test tasks in a jenkins server - list and view in various ways, and
cancel tasks.

## Requirements

package `python3-jenkins-1.7.0-6.fc36.noarch`

You must have Kerberos authentication set up.

You have to create a file `~/.config/jenkins.yml` like this:
```yaml
somename:
  username: MY_USERNAME
  url: "https://my.jenkins.hostname.tld"
  job_name: MY_JENKINS_JOBNAME
  token: "MY_JENKINS_TOKEN"
current: somename
```

## Usage

By default, it will print the queued tasks, the running tasks, and the completed tasks.
```
> ./manage_jenkins.py
Queued tasks:

...
```
It takes a long time to run.  You can shorten the duration by using the environment variable
`MAX_TASK_AGE` (number of seconds of maximum task age) e.g.
```
> MAX_TASK_AGE=7200 ./manage_jenkins.py
Queued tasks:
...

```
e.g. to skip tasks older than 2 hours.

You can also specify the argument `print_queued_tasks`, `print_running_tasks`, or `print_completed_tasks`
if you just want to look at those tasks.
```
> ./manage_jenkins.py print_queued_tasks
Queued tasks:
QueueID  Queued Since        Role            PR  Platform               Queue Reason

...
```
Use `print_task_info TASK_NUM` to show a YAML representation of a task:
```
> ./manage_jenkins.py print_task_info 15967
_class: hudson.model.FreeStyleBuild
actions:
- _class: hudson.model.ParametersAction
  parameters:
  - _class: hudson.model.StringParameterValue
    name: priority
    value: '3'
...
```
which isn't very useful unless you are debugging the script and/or Jenkins itself.

### print_task_tests_info

Use this to see information about the task, including the individual tests
statuses.
```
> ./manage_jenkins.py print_task_tests_info 12345

```
`Node` is the internal node name used by Jenkins.  `Workspace` is the path to
the directory on the node which is used to hold the test artifacts before they
are published.  For example, if you want to see the ansible results for the
completed tests_bind_high_availability.yml test:
```
ssh -i /path/to/key root@10.0.0.3
cd /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/ci-test-jobname@6
# from here you can see citool-debug.txt, etc.
cat work-tests_bind_high_availability.ymlrHBR08/ansible-output.txt
cat guest-setup-c3767ea3-934c-408d-b42f-d7639e3e30ca/pre-installation-artifact-workaround.txt
etc.
```

### print_task_console

If you just want to see the task output without having to use the web browser:
```
./manage_jenkins.py print_task_console 12345 30

### cancel_tasks

This requires a valid `token`.  Cancel the running task given by the id.
```
./manage_jenkins.py cancel_tasks 18859 18858 ....
```

### cancel_duplicate_tasks

This requires a valid `token`. There is currently a bug in Jenkins that will
create duplicate tasks.  Using this command will remove duplicate tasks from the
queue and running tasks.
```
./manage_jenkins.py cancel_duplicate_tasks
```

### cancel_pr_tasks

This requires a valid `token`.  Cancel the running task given by the PR in the
form `role:number`.
```
./manage_jenkins.py cancel_pr_tasks storage:555
```

### print_test_failures

Print the failed tests from the tasks that match the given role, prnum, and platform.
Platform is optional.  This is useful for roles that have a lot of long running
tests, and you don't want to wait several hours to find out if any of the tests
have failed.  See also `print_task_tests_info`.
```
./manage_jenkins.py print_test_failures network 535

# check-fact-gather-results.sh

Used to see if fact gathering in roles is working correctly.  Roles should
gather only the subset of facts required for the role, and should only gather
facts if those facts are not already present in `ansible_facts`.  The script
parses the ansible logs from test runs looking for a task
`TASK .*$role : Ensure ansible_facts used by role`
or in the case of the network role
`TASK .*network : Ensure ansible_facts used by role are present`
If facts were gathered, the result of the task will be `ok`, otherwise, it will
be `skipping` if the facts were already present. By default, Ansible will gather
facts as the first thing it does when you run a playbook.  You will see this in
the Ansible log as `TASK [Gathering Facts]`. If the test uses
`gather_facts: false`, or if the user specifies the env. var.
`ANSIBLE_GATHERING=explicit` (or the equivalent Ansible config), then you will
not see this in the logs.
For the normal case, the script looks to see if the `Ensure ansible_facts` task
has a result of `skipping`, except in a few special cases.
If running without fact gathering, the script looks to see if the
`Ensure ansible_facts` task has a result of `ok`, except in a few special cases,
and if the test has already gathered facts in a previous task (which are special
cases noted in the script).

If you specify a link, this link is assumed to be a Beaker job result XML file.  Every
log specified in this file will be scanned.
If you specify a role name and a PR number, every log specified in the PR CI results
will be scanned.

# check-logs-for-packages.sh

Used to scan logs for references to packages used with the `package` task, and
generate the lists of packages required for `ostree` images for a given
distribution and version, and also for runtime and testing.  Typically used like
this:

```bash
ROLE_PARENT_DIR=~/linux-system-roles log_dir=/var/tmp/lsr ./check-logs-for-packages.sh rolename PR rolename PR ....
```

This will download all of the integration test logs from each given rolename/PR
combination to `log_dir` and create the lists of packages.  You must have run
the PR with the `tests/callback_plugins/dump_packages.py` plugin in place to
dump the packages used.  The directory `ROLE_PARENT_DIR` should have the role
subdirectories in either the form `rolename/` or `linux-system-roles.rolename/`.
It will update the `.ostree/` directory in each role with the package files.

# configure_squid

The `configure_squid` directory stores the playbook that you can use to
configure a Squid caching proxy server for caching RPM packages. The playbook
copies the `squid.conf` file to the managed node. The `squid.conf` file 
configures Squid to use SSL Bump to cache RPM packages over HTTPS and does some
further configurations required for RPM packages caching. You can compare
`squid.conf` with `squid.conf.default` to see what `squid.conf` adds.

After you configure a squid proxy using this playbook, you must point dnf or yum
to use this proxy. To do that, append the following strings to /etc/yum.conf on
EL 6 or to /etc/dnf/dnf.conf on EL > 6 and Fedora:

```
proxy=http://<squid_server_ip>:3128
sslverify=False
```

# lsr_fingerprint.py

Introduced to modify fingerprint in spec file to be `system_role:$rolename`.

`lsr_fingerprint.py` scans files in the `templates` dir under `./role["lsrrolename"]`,
if the file contains a string `role["reponame"]:role["rolename"]`,
replaces it with `system_role:role["lsrrolename"]`. Note: `role` is an entry
of `roles` that is defined as an array of dictionaries in `lsr_fingerprint.py`.

For example, in metrics, `performancecopilot:ansible-pcp` is replaced with
`system_role:metrics`; in sshd, `willshersystems:ansible-sshd` is with
`system_role:sshd`.
