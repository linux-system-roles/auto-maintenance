# role2collection is currently done using ruamel rt with a long line length,
# because we can't ensure converted lines will be wrapped preserving
# Jinja and ansible syntax.  This means we trigger a lot of warnings like
# this when importing into Galaxy:
# roles/file.yml:61: yaml line too long (187 > 160 characters)
# the only thing we can do is suppress these
rules:
  line-length: disable
